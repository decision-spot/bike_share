    "Looking at the `output_df`, you may notice stations that see a transfer of bikes (addition or removal) at every hour. Even worse are those stations where some bikes are removed from them in one hour but then bikes are added to them in the next hour. We know these additions/removals consume time and money. What can we do to avoid this situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to formulate this is to introduce a fixed cost for the use of the truck (or the bicycle trailer) that transfers the bikes and then add this term to the objective function. With a cost associated with the transfer, the model is incentivized to use fewer number of transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, we should calculate the number of times a transfer has occurred. Any time bikes are added to a station or removed from a station, a transfer has happened. So, we need a way to link addition of bikes and removal of bikes to a transfer. One way to achieve this is to introduce two new binary variables as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{i,t}\\quad$: 1 if any bike is added to station $i$ at hour $t$; 0 otherwise\n",
    "- $w_{i,t}\\quad$: 1 if any bike is removed from station $i$ at hour $t$; 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to establish the relationship between $b_{i,t}$ with $x_{i,t}$ and $w_{i,t}$. Basically, we want to say:\n",
    "if $b_{i,t} \\ge 0$, then $x_{i,t} = 1$ and if $b_{i,t} \\le 0$, then $w_{i,t} = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the following two constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&b_{i,t} \\le M x_{i,t} &\\quad \\forall i \\in I, t \\in T \\tag{11}\\\\\n",
    "&-b_{i,t} \\le M w_{i,t} &\\quad \\forall i \\in I, t \\in T \\tag{12}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is a large number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint 11 ensures that if $b_{i,t}\\ge 0$, then $x_{i,t} = 1$. But by itself, this constraint cannot make $x_{i,t} =0$ if $b_{i,t} \\le 0$. The same is true with constraint 12. It ensures that negative values of $b_{i,t}$ make $w_{i,t} = 1$. However, it cannot force $w_{i,t} = 0$ if $b_{i,t} \\ge 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total number of transfers is equal to sum of $x_{i,t}$ and $w_{i,t}$ and our goal is to minimize number of transfers. So, we add these terms to the objective function. In other words, our new objective function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{i,t} (l_{i,t} + x_{i,t} + w_{i,t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since minimizing total transfers is desired, the objective function tries to make both $x_{i,t}$ and $w_{i,t}$ to be zero. Along with constraints 11 and 12, this means that for cases where $x_{i,t}$ and $w_{i,t}$ can take either 0 or 1, objective function forces them to get a value of 0. Moreover, since any extra transfer causes either $x_{i,t}$ or $w_{i,t}$ to be 1, the model is incentivized to have fewer transfers in order to minimize the objective function."
